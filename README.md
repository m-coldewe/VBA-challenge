# Stock Market Analysis with VBA

## Overview
The project uses VBA for excel to analyze generated stock market data.


## Purpose
Creates a script to:
- create column headers for summary data
- read through the entire dataset
- report each ticker ID
- calculate and report the change for each stock for the year
- calculate and report the percent change for each stock for the year
- calculate and report the volume for each stock for the year
- apply formatting to show at a glance if the change for year change and percent change were positive or negative
- find and report the ticker Id and value with the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and the Greatest Total Volume for each year

I had a difficult time with the conditional formatting - not with the code, itself, but with where to put it. My classmate, Cesar, suggested putting it in it's own for loop. Harsh contributed the code for Last_Row.
